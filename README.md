3 Tiered App employing HTTP POST, body-Parser, SuperAgent, and Faker

Module 22

I cannot get an image to appear with my Bootstrap card. The data will display, but not an image. I double checked all the "avatar" pieced of code and it matches the starter files.

I cannot get the Postman piece to work with DIgital Ocean.

I tried redoing it with Heroku and the app won't work on Heroku, so I can't even try the Postman piece.
